# General
This folder should contain a list of all files you want to rename and to what name they should be renamed. 
The list should named "list.txt", but you can always change it on Line 8 to another name. 

### Usage
Construction of the list: 

<old_name>: <new_name> 

Be aware that duplicates will crash the application!
